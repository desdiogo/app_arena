## About Project

The project was developed using the following stacks:

- Backend Php 7.4/Laravel 8
- Frontend Inertia/Vue3/Tailwindcss

## Description

- To create a new customer you must login first, if you don't have a record, you can create a new user in the endpoint register
- When the customer is created he will be able to register his numbers
- Preferences are automatically registered when the number is created.
- I didn't use tests because I hardly studied the subject
